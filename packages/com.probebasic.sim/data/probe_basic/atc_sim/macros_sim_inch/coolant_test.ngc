(settings for setup are located on probe basic setting page)
(in the programmable coolant constants container.)
(calculations assume coolant nozzle is on axis b and has been homed)
(to 0 degrees rotation aiming perpendicular to the spindle center line)
(coolant nozzle is located on the right side of the spindle head and)
(rotates counter clockwise from home position with commands)
